## Hello, CUFIC here
- I am an intermiate programmer/game designer and currently a senior in high school (as of 2025).
## What am I working towards?
- I am very interested in Artificial Intelligence and game design
- I am mainly focused on learning more about A.I. and how to program them, both as chatbots and as tools.
## I look forward to working with all of the wonderful people on Github
